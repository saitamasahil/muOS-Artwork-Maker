# muOS-Artwork-Scraper-Manual-Version-
This script allows users to manually scrape artwork for muOS systems like NES, SNES, and more. It is particularly useful when the automated tool Scrappy (https://github.com/gabrielfvale/scrappy) fails to generate the required 3px dither art. The script requires the user to provide `screenshot.png` (the base image) and `wheel.png`.
